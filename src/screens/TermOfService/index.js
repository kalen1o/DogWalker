<p>
<strong>1. Acceptance of Terms; Modifications.</strong>
These Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) are a binding legal agreement between you and A Place for Walker, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware with a registered office at 711 Capitol Way S., Suite 204, Olympia, WA 98501 (“<strong>Walker</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>” and “<strong>our</strong>”).
The Terms govern your use of our software applications, resources and services for pet owners and pet service providers to find each other, communicate with each other, and arrange for the provision of pet care services (collectively, our “<strong>Walker Service</strong>”).
The Terms govern all use of the Walker Service, whether you access it from our website at https://www.DowWalker.com (or any localized version) (the “<strong>Site</strong>”), our mobile applications and mobile websites, our Facebook application, our online or phone support offerings, or any other access point we make available to you.
Our <a className={classes.a} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/terms/guarantee/">Walker Guarantee Terms</a>, <a className={classes.a} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/terms/reservation-protection/">Booking Protection Policy</a> and other Policies applicable to your use of the Walker Service are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.
BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS DURING THE ACCOUNT SIGN-UP PROCESS OR ACCESSING OR USING THE WALKER SERVICE WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THEM, IN WHICH CASE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THE WALKER SERVICE.
</p>
<p>
You understand and agree that we may change the Terms from time to time, and that any such changes will be effective (except as otherwise described in Section 17.10 below) when we post the modified Terms on the Walker Service, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
Your continued access and use of the Walker Service after we post the modified Terms will constitute your consent to be bound by the modified Terms.
</p>

<p><strong>2. Walker Service.</strong></p>
<p>
<u>2.1 Nature of the Walker Service</u>.
The Walker Service consists of a desktop Web application, mobile applications, and other related tools, support and services that pet owners (“<strong>Pet Owners</strong>”) and providers of pet-related services (“<strong>Service Providers</strong>”) can use to find, communicate with and interact with each other.
The Walker Service includes our emergency support services, educational materials for Service Providers, and other services.
We charge fees for some aspects of the Walker Service, as described below in Section 9.
</p>
<p>
<u>2.2 Walker does not provide Pet Care Services.</u>.
Walker is a neutral venue for Service Providers and Pet Owners.
Walker is not a Service Provider and, except for emergency phone support and other resources and support specifically described in the Walker Service, does not provide pet care services.
We make no representations or warranties about the quality of boarding, pet sitting, dog walking, house sitting, or other services provided by Service Providers (“<strong>Pet Care Services</strong>”), or about your interactions and dealings with users.
Service Providers listed on Walker are not under the direction or control of Walker, and Service Providers determine in their own discretion how to provide Pet Care Services.
Though we provide general guidance on our Site to Service Providers about safety and pet care and to Pet Owners about selecting and engaging Service Providers, Walker does not employ, recommend or endorse Service Providers or Pet Owners, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Service Providers or Pet Owners, whether online or offline.
We conduct an initial review of Service Provider profiles and we facilitate Background Checks or Identification Verifications (each as described in Section 10, below) on Service Providers conducted by a third party, but, except where explicitly specified in the Walker Service (and then only to the extent specified), do not otherwise screen Service Providers or Pet Owners.
You should exercise caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Service Provider, providing Pet Care Services, or otherwise interacting with users via the Walker Service.  Pet Owners and Service Providers are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets.
For example, each user of the Walker Service is responsible for keeping current his or her own pet’s vaccinations, and we will have no liability for anyone’s failure to vaccinate his or her pet.
</p>
<p>
<u>2.3 Release</u>.
<strong>Subject to Section 16 below, our liability for any claims, injuries, loss, harm and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to your interactions or dealings with other users and the acts and/or omissions of Service Providers and Pet Owners, whether online or offline, is limited to the amounts and obligations set forth in the Walker Guarantee.</strong>
<strong>You acknowledge and agree that, except to the extent we have liability under the Walker Guarantee, and to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, YOUR USE AND/OR PROVISION OF PET CARE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<u>2.4 Transactions are between Pet Owners and Service Providers</u>.
The Walker Service may be used to find and offer Pet Care Services and to facilitate payment, but all transactions conducted via the Walker Service are between Pet Owners and Service Providers.
Except for the limited refunds and  “Booking Protection” specified in Section 9.6 and the Walker Guarantee, you agree that Walker has no liability for damages associated with Pet Care Services (which may include bodily injury to, or death of, a pet) or resulting from any other transactions between users of the Walker Service.
</p>
<p>
<u>2.5 Bookings</u>.
Pet Owners and Service Providers transact with each other on the Walker Service when they both agree to a “booking” that specifies the fees, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of Pet Care Services via the booking mechanism provided on the Walker Service (a “Booking”).
A Booking may be initiated by either a Service Provider or a Pet Owner by selecting the type(s) of Pet Care Services to be provided and then following the prompts that appear on-screen.
If you are a Pet Owner and you initiate a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click “Request &amp; Pay.”
If you are a Pet Owner and a Service Provider initiates a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click “Pay Now.”
All requests are subject to acceptance by the receiving party.
The receiving party is not obligated to accept your (or any) request and may, at their discretion, decline for any reason.
You acknowledge that, once you complete a Booking, you agree to honor the price and other terms of that Booking, as acknowledged in the Booking confirmation.
</p>
<p>
<u>2.6 Pet Owners are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Service Providers</u>.
Pet Owners are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of Service Providers for the services they offer to provide.
Please visit the <a className={classes.a} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.Walker.com/hc/en-us/">Help Center</a> for guidance about making informed decisions about engaging Service Providers.
Though Walker performs a limited review of Service Provider profiles and facilitates Service Provider Background Checks or Identity Verifications conducted by a third party, any such screening is limited, and Walker does not warrant that any such screen is accurate, complete, conclusive or up-to-date.
Similarly, Walker does not endorse reviews of Service Providers by other Pet Owners that may be available via the Walker Service, and Walker makes no commitments that such reviews are accurate or legitimate.
</p>
<p>
<u>2.7 Abandoned Pets; Re-homing</u>.
Pet Owners who arrange for Pet Care Services and fail to retrieve their pet after the service period identified in a Booking agree that Walker (or the Service Provider) may, in its (or his or her) sole discretion, place the pet in foster care, transfer care to animal control or other law enforcement authorities, or find other alternate care.
Pet Owner agrees to reimburse Walker and/or the Service Provider for all costs and expenses associated with such actions.
Further, Walker expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove a Pet Owner’s pet from a Service Provider’s care should Walker deem it necessary for the safety of a pet, the Service Provider, or any persons living with the Service Provider.
Prior to removing a pet from the care of a Service Provider, Walker will use reasonable efforts during its normal business hours to contact the Pet Owner and/or the Pet Owner’s emergency contact (if provided) to arrange alternative care.
Should Walker not be able to contact the Pet Owner or the emergency contact, Walker will use its best judgment to find alternative care for the pet until the Pet Owner is able to retrieve his/her pet.
If you are a Pet Owner, you authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to Walker in connection with any such relocation or re-homing of your pet.
In addition, you are responsible for and agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Walker in connection with such transfer.
</p>
<p>
<u>2.8 Emergencies</u>.
We recommend that Pet Owners give their Service Providers contact information where they can be reached in the event medical care for a pet becomes necessary.
Service Providers agree to immediately contact Pet Owners in the event such care becomes necessary or, if the Pet Owner is not available, to contact Walker at the applicable telephone number or email address listed in the table at the end of these Terms.
If you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize your Service Provider and Walker to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be reached to authorize care yourself in an emergency situation.
In such case, you also authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to Walker.
If your Service Provider reaches you with a request to authorize medical care for your pet and you refuse, you release the Service Provider and Walker for any injury, damage or liability arising from failure to seek such care, including from reimbursement that may otherwise have been available under the Walker Guarantee.
Pet Owners are responsible for the costs of any such medical treatment for pets and, if you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize Walker to charge your credit card or other payment method for such costs.
In certain circumstances, a Pet Owner may be eligible for reimbursement under the Walker Guarantee.  Walker recommends that all users have adequate pet insurance to cover the costs of veterinary care.
</p>
<p>
<u>2.9 Consultation Services</u>.
Walker may offer Pet Owners and Service Providers phone, chat, or email veterinary consultation services from a third party to provide an educational resource for decisions you make about your own pets or pets in your care.
These consultation services are provided by a third party, and are not a part of the Walker Service.
If you use these third party consultation services, you should use them only in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, professional veterinary care.
You agree to resort solely to the applicable third party consultation service in the event of any claims arising from their services.
</p>

<p>
<strong>3. Compliance with Applicable Law.</strong>
By accessing and using the Walker Service, you certify that you: (1) are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher, and (2) will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your activities conducted through, or related to, the Walker Service.
</p>
<ul className={classes.ul}>
<li className={classes.theli}>For Pet Owners, this means, among other things, that you will ensure that your pets are vaccinated, licensed, identification-tagged and/or microchipped as required by local laws or regulations; that you have obtained and will maintain any mandatory insurance policies concerning the pets whose care you entrust to Service Providers (and that such policies will benefit third parties, including Service Providers, to the same extent they benefit you).</li>
<li className={classes.theli}>
    For Service Providers, this includes that you are legally eligible to provide Pet Care Services in the jurisdiction where you provide Pet Care Services; that you have complied and will comply with all laws and regulations that are applicable to you; that you have obtained all business licenses and permits necessary to legally provide Pet Care Services; and that, when providing Pet Care Services, you will comply with applicable leash, pet waste disposal, and similar laws.
    
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You acknowledge that Walker is entitled to rely on these commitments from you, is not responsible to ensure that all users have complied with applicable laws and regulations, and will not be liable for a user’s failure to do so.

</p>

<p><strong>9. Fees &amp; Payment.</strong></p>
<p>
<u>9.1 Currency</u>.
All fees, deductible amounts and other payments referenced on, or charged through, the Walker Service are listed and payable in local currency.
</p>
<p>
<u>9.2 Fees for Pet Owners</u>.
Pet Owners may purchase Pet Care Services from a Service Provider by completing a Booking as described in Section 2.5.
If you are a Pet Owner, you enter into a transaction with the Service Provider when you accept a Booking, and you agree to pay the total fees indicated in the Booking.
Except where otherwise specifically indicated on the Walker Service, fees for Pet Care Services are determined by Service Providers.
As described in Sections 9.3 and 9.4, the total amount Pet Owners are charged for a Booking may also include a service fee payable to Walker.
Where required by law, the amount charged will also be inclusive of applicable taxes.
The Service Provider, not Walker, is responsible for performing the Pet Care Services.
</p>
<p>
<u>9.3 Fees for Service Providers</u>.
Service Providers may agree to provide Pet Care Services to a Pet Owner by agreeing to a Booking as described in Section 2.5.
If you are a Service Provider, you must confirm the Booking before it expires or the Pet Owner will have no obligation to complete the transaction.
Once the Booking is completed by both parties, you agree to honor the price set forth in your Booking.
The purchase of Pet Care Services is a transaction between the Pet Owner and the Service Provider.
Walker’s role is to facilitate the transaction.
We will (either directly or indirectly through an authorized third party) collect payment from the Pet Owner at the time of Booking and (except to the extent of any payment hold pursuant to Section 9.7) initiate payment to the Service Provider’s account 48 hours after completion of the service period indicated in the Booking.
Service Providers are charged a service fee as described in Section 9.4, which we deduct before remitting payment to Service Providers.
Where required by law, the amount charged will also be inclusive of applicable taxes.
</p>
<p>
<u>9.4 Service Fees</u>.
We charge service fees for some aspects of the Walker Service.
If you are a Service Provider, except where otherwise specified via the Walker Service, our service fee is calculated as a percentage of the fees a Pet Owner agrees to pay to you in a Booking.
We deduct this service fee from the amounts paid by the Pet Owner.
Our service fees are described <a className={classes.a} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.Walker.com/hc/en-us/articles/205385304-What-are-the-service-fees-">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<u>9.5 Late Fees and Additional Charges</u>.
If you are a Pet Owner, you acknowledge and agree that, if you fail to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking, you will be charged for additional service time (<em>pro rata</em> for each partial late day) at the daily rate established in the Booking.
In addition, you agree to indemnify Walker from, and agree that we may charge your credit card or other payment method for, any additional costs and expenses we or the Service Provider incur as a result of your failure to retrieve your pet at the end of the service period agreed in a Booking.
</p>
<p>
<u>9.6 Cancellations &amp; Refunds</u>.
</p>
<ul className={classes.ul}>
<li className={classes.theli}>
    <em>Booking Protection.</em>
    As more fully described on Walker’s <a className={classes.a} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/terms/reservation-protection/">Booking Protection</a> page, Walker can help you find replacement Service Providers when Service Providers cancel Bookings near the start date of the service period identified in the Booking.
The availability of the Booking Protection depends on the timing of the cancellation and the type of Pet Care Services provided; consult the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/terms/reservation-protection/">Booking Protection</a> page for details.
</li>
<li className={classes.theli}>
    <em>Cancellations by Service Provider.</em>
    If a Service Provider cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period identified in the Booking, we will refund the fees paid by the Pet Owner for Pet Care Services not provided, as well as any service charge paid to Walker.
If you are a Service Provider, you can appoint a substitute Service Provider (as agreed by the Pet Owner and so long as the substitute has an active account on the Walker Service and has agreed in writing to accept a Booking) by contacting Walker to modify the Booking.
If you do not find a substitute and repeatedly cancel accepted Bookings without justification, Walker may terminate your account.
</li>
<li className={classes.theli}>
    <em>Cancellations by Pet Owner.</em>
    If a Pet Owner cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period specified in a Booking, we will refund fees in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Service Provider on the Walker Service.
All Service Providers are required to select a cancellation policy prior to completing a Booking so that Pet Owners are aware of the cancellation policy prior to Booking.
For more information about cancellation policies, please visit the <a className={classes.a} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://support.Walker.com/hc/en-us/">Help Center</a>.
</li>
<li className={classes.theli}>
    <em>Force Majeure.</em>
    The cancellation policies described herein may not apply in the event of certain emergency situations beyond the control of Service Providers and/or Pet Owners that make it impossible or impractical to perform agreed Bookings, such as evacuations resulting from earthquake, hurricane, wildfire, flood, war, riots or other similar disaster.
In such cases Walker may, in its reasonable discretion, issue refunds under terms that vary from a Service Provider’s selected cancellation policy.
</li>
<li className={classes.theli}>
    <em>Refunds for Failure to Perform.</em>
    If we determine in our reasonable discretion that a Service Provider has failed to provide Pet Care Services as agreed with the Pet Owner or is otherwise in breach of these Terms, then we may, in our reasonable discretion, cancel a Booking and/or issue a full or partial refund to a Pet Owner.
</li>
<li className={classes.theli}>
    <em>General Terms for Cancellations.</em>
    If you wish to cancel a Booking, you should use the mechanisms available through the Walker Service to do so.
For purposes of the policies and terms in this Section 9.6, the date of cancellation is the date that a user cancels through the Walker Service, regardless of any separate communications between users outside of the Walker Service.
</li>
<li className={classes.theli}>
    <em>Payment Disputes; Payment Outside of the Walker Service.</em>
    Walker initiates payments to Service Providers 48 hours after completion of a Booking.
Once these amounts have been disbursed, any further payment disputes are between the Pet Owner and Service Provider, and Walker has no obligation to mediate or facilitate any resolution.
Further, Walker has no responsibility or liability with respect to any tips, bonuses, or other payments made outside of the Walker Service.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<u>9.7 Payment Holds</u>.
If you are a Service Provider, Walker reserves the right to issue a hold on amounts otherwise payable to you pursuant to Section 9.3 if there is a reasonable suspicion of fraudulent activity involving your account(s) or for other similarly compelling reason involving protection of Walker, the Walker community or third party rights.
We may also recommend that third party payment service providers restrict your access to funds in your account under the same circumstances.
</p>
<p>
<u>9.8 Authorization to Charge</u>.
When you pay for Pet Care Services or for other services on the Walker Service, you will be required to provide us with valid, up-to-date credit card or other payment information and to maintain that payment information (or an acceptable alternative payment method) on file with your account so long as you have any outstanding, confirmed Bookings.
You authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for fees you incur on the Walker Service as they become due and payable, and to charge any alternative payment method Walker has on record for you in the event your primary payment method is expired, invalid, or otherwise not able to be charged.
You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date payment information.
If we cannot charge you for fees when due because your payment information is no longer valid, or if we do not receive your payment when due, then you understand that neither Walker nor the Service Provider will be responsible for any failure to provide services associated with those fees.
Except as expressly provided in these Terms, all fees paid via the Walker Service are non-refundable once paid.
</p>
<p>
<u>9.9 Taxes</u>.
Except for taxes on Walker’s income and gross receipts or where Walker is otherwise required to collect taxes, you acknowledge that you are solely responsible to pay any applicable taxes that arise as a result of your purchase, provision, or use of Pet Care Services via the Walker Service.
This includes, without limitation, any form of sales tax, VAT, or income tax on fees paid or received by you through the Walker Service.
</p>


<p><strong>10. Background Checks and Identity Verifications.</strong></p>
<p>
Walker may provide Service Providers with access to third party consumer reporting agencies that perform, among other things, personal identification verification services (“<strong>Identity Verification</strong>”) or criminal records checks, sex offender registry checks, motor vehicle records checks and/or identification verifications (collectively, “<strong>Background Checks</strong>”).
Outside of the US and Canada, these services are limited to Identity Verification.
We do not provide, and are not responsible or liable in any manner for, the Background Checks or Identity Verifications, and we do not endorse or make any representations or warranties regarding the reliability of such Background Checks or Identity Verifications or the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of any information in the Background Checks or Identity Verifications.
We do not independently verify information in the Background Checks or Identity Verifications.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p><strong>17. Arbitration Agreement.</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH Walker AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</strong>
<strong>IF YOU RESIDE WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, THIS SECTION APPLIES ONLY TO BUSINESS CUSTOMERS (NOT “CONSUMERS”).  IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER RESIDING WITHIN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, PLEASE SEE SECTION 18.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<u>17.1 Arbitration Agreement; Claims</u>.
This Section 17 is referred to as the "Arbitration Agreement” in these Terms.
Unless you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in accordance with the procedure described in Section 17.9 below, you and Walker (together, the “Parties”) agree that any and all disputes or claims that arise between you and Walker relating to the Walker Service, interactions with others on the Walker Service, and/or these Terms (including any alleged breach of these Terms) (collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”), except for Excluded Claims (defined in the following sentence), will be resolved  as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement.
As used herein, “Excluded Claims” means (1) individual claims brought in small claims court (if your claims qualify), (2) claims arising out of or related to a violation of Section 4.1, above, (3) claims in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property (including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents), and (4) claims that, as a matter of applicable law, cannot be made subject to arbitration.
</p>
<p>
<u>17.2 Agreement to Arbitrate</u>.
Unless you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement in accordance with the procedure described in Section 17.9 below, you agree that any and all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be resolved exclusively <strong>on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, rather than in a court,</strong> in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, and <strong>your rights in connection with all Claims (other than Excluded Claims) will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not by a judge or jury</strong>.
The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
To the extent that the Parties' dispute involves both timely filed Excluded Claims and other Claims subject to this Agreement, the Parties agree to bifurcate and stay for the duration of the arbitration proceedings any such Excluded Claims.
</p>
<p>
<u>17.3 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</u>.
<strong>YOU AND Walker AGREE THAT, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 17.9 BELOW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN A PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION CANNOT BE WAIVED AS A MATTER OF LAW) AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</strong>
<strong>UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Walker AGREE OTHERWISE (OR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN A PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION CANNOT BE WAIVED AS A MATTER OF LAW), THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</strong>
<strong>ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER Walker SERVICE USERS.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<u>17.4 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</u>.
Before you commence arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint.
Our preference will always be to resolve complaints amicably and efficiently, without the need for arbitration.
You may contact us via email at <a className={classes.a} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:legal@Walker.com">legal@Walker.com</a> or by mail at A Place for Walker, Inc., Attn:  Legal, 711 Capitol Way S., Suite 204, Olympia, WA 98501.
If the issue is not resolved and results in arbitration, we will need to mutually select and agree upon an arbitrator and the rules and procedures to govern the arbitration.
</p>
<p>
<u>17.5 Arbitration Procedures</u>.
The Parties will try in good faith to mutually select and agree upon an arbitrator and rules and procedures to govern the arbitration.
If we cannot agree, then the arbitration will be conducted in English by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with your choice of the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) or the Rules of the International Center for Dispute Resolution (the “ICDR Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.
The rules that apply are those in effect when arbitration is demanded by either of the Parties.
The JAMS Rules are available at <a className={classes.a} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration">https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration</a>, and the ICDR Rules are available at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.icdr.org/rules_forms_fees">https://www.icdr.org/rules_forms_fees</a>, and both Rules are incorporated in these Terms by reference.
You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the Rules or waive your opportunity to read the Rules and any claim that the Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
If there is any inconsistency between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.
The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 16.
Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law.
The arbitrator shall submit a decision in writing, specifying the findings of fact and the conclusions of law on which the decision is based.
Decisions by the arbitrator are binding and enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
</p>
<p>
The arbitration will be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 USD (or equivalent in local currency) or less, you or Walker may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election will be binding on you and Walker subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.
Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or Walker, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington (or of England and Wales if you are located outside of the United States or Canada), including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.
The arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Walker users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Walker user to the extent required by applicable law.
As limited by applicable law, these Terms and the applicable JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have (1) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Claim, including the determination of whether a Claim is arbitrable, and (2) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
</p>
<p>
<u>17.6 Costs of Arbitration</u>.
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "<strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>") will be shared equally by you and Walker, except where prohibited by applicable law.
In addition, (1) if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Walker will pay your portion of such fees, and (2) if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Walker will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.
Each party will be solely responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees.
In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Walker for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Walker on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the JAMS or ICDR Rules.
</p>
<p>
<u>17.7 Confidentiality</u>.
All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
</p>
<p>
<u>17.8 Severability</u>.
If any term, clause or provision of this Section 17 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 17 will remain valid and enforceable.
</p>
<p>
<u>17.9 Opt-Out Procedure</u>.
You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice ("<strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>") in accordance with the terms of this Section 17.9.
The Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time.
You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to A Place for Walker, Inc., Attn: Legal, 711 Capitol Way S., Suite 204, Olympia, WA 98501.
The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to register for the Walker Service to which the opt-out applies.
You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.
This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement.
If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, the entire Arbitration Agreement will not apply with respect to you, but the remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.
Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.
By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Claims (including Excluded Claims) in accordance with Section 18.
</p>
<p>
<u>17.10 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</u>.
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Walker prior to the effective date of the change.
Moreover, if we terminate this Arbitration Agreement by removing it from these Terms, such termination will not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and will not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Walker prior to the effective date of removal.
</p>

<p><strong>18. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p>
18.1
For users in the United States and Canada, these Terms, and any dispute between you and Walker, will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, except that the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 17 (the Arbitration Agreement).
Unless you and we agree otherwise, or except where prohibited by applicable law, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that arises between you and Walker must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Washington.
You and Walker agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Seattle, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
</p>
<p>
18.2
For users in the EEA (and the United Kingdom should it no longer be part of the EEA), the laws of England shall govern these terms, except that if you live in a country outside of England but within the EEA, certain mandatory applicable laws of your country will apply for your benefit and protection in addition to or instead of certain provisions of English law.
Any dispute that arises between you and Walker must be resolved by the English courts or the courts in your country if you live in the EEA outside of England.
</p>
<p>
18.3
If you are a consumer in the European Economic Area, the European Online Dispute Resolution platform <a className={classes.a} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr">http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr</a> provides information about alternative dispute resolution, which you may use if there is a dispute that cannot be resolved between you and the relevant party. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>19. Miscellaneous</strong>.
Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, worker, or employee of the other.
Neither party will have, or hold itself out to any third party as having, any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that will be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound.
The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms will in no way effect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms.
In the event a term or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms will be enforceable as so modified.
To the maximum extent possible under applicable local law, this Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
