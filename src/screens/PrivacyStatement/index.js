<h2 id="share" className={classes.privacy_policy_header}>How Do We Share Your Information?</h2>
<p>We may share the personal information we collect with third parties as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Statement:</p>
<ul className={classes.ul}>
<li> className={classes.theli}when you make or accept a booking;</li>
<li className={classes.theli}>when you sign up for and participate in the interactive areas of our Services, such as creating a user profile or writing a review;</li>

</ul>
<h3>Social Sharing Features</h3>
<p>The Services may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of information collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.</p>
<h3>Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Third Parties</h3>
<p>We may allow others to provide analytics services and/or serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These entities may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other similar technologies to collect information about your use of our websites and third-party websites. To learn more about how these third parties use these technologies and how to manage your preferences, please read our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/terms/cookies/">Cookie Policy</a>. Note that if you opt-out of third-party advertising cookies, you will still see online ads, but they will not be personalized.</p>

<h2 id="security" className={classes.privacy_policy_header}>Information Security</h2>
<p>Walker takes reasonable measures designed to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or through mobile applications is 100% safe. Therefore, although we use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<h3>Transfer and Location of Information</h3>
<p>The information we collect may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, or in any other country where we or our affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. The processing locations are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect information in the event of an outage or other problem. We take steps designed to ensure that the information we collect under this statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and applicable law wherever the information is located.</p>
<p>We transfer information from the UK, European Economic Area and Switzerland to the United States and other countries that have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. When we do so, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including executing the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, to help ensure your rights and protections. To learn more about the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, please click <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="retention" className={classes.privacy_policy_header}>Information Retention</h2>
<p>We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different information types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the information, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete information, and our legal or contractual obligations. </p>

<h2 id="choices" className={classes.privacy_policy_header}>Your Choices</h2>
<h3>Managing Your Account</h3>
<p>You may update, correct or delete certain information about you at any time by logging into your account through our website or our mobile application and navigating to the ‘Profile’ link.

<p>If you wish to deactivate your account, please contact us using the contact information below. We may decline requests that are prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or other rights of another person, where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the information relates, or are not required to be honored by applicable law. </p>
<h3>Location Information</h3>
<p>When you first install or launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application’s collection of this information. We require location information to use certain features of our Services, so if you do not consent to this collection, you cannot use those features. If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, certain features of our mobile applications will no longer function. You may also stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove our mobile application from your device.</p>
<h3>Emails</h3>
<p>You may choose whether you wish to receive marketing emails from Walker by updating your “Notifications” preferences under “Account Settings” in your online Walker profile or through our mobile application.  If you receive marketing emails and you wish to opt-out, you may also do so by clicking “Unsubscribe” in those emails. If you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you Service-related emails, such as those about your account or your ongoing business relationship with us.</p>
<h3>Mobile Push Notifications/Alerts</h3>
<p>We may send push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.</p>
<h3>Text Messages</h3>
<p>With your consent as required by applicable law, we may send marketing and/or service-related text messages to your mobile device. You may opt out of receiving these messages by following the prompt in an individual message or updating your “Notifications” preferences under “Account Settings” in your online Walker profile or through our mobile application.  However, if you are a Service Provider in the U.S. or Canada, certain Pet Care Services that you provide (as detailed in the Walker Service) may require you to receive service-related messages.  If you do not want to receive these service-related text messages, then in addition to adjusting your Notifications preferences, you must withdraw from providing such Pet Care Services.</p>
